\chapter{Transport Layer Security}
TLS, or Transport Layer Security, was originally proposed by Netscape
in 1995 as a way to secure communications between a web browser and a
web server. It is the successor to SSL, or Secure Sockets Layer, which
was first introduced by Netscape in 1995. The two terms are often used
interchangeably, but TLS is the more modern and secure protocol.\\ 
The main goal of SSL was to create secure network channel, almost at
session level(4.5), between two parties, to provide some security
services that neither TCP nor IP provides:
\begin{itemize}
  \item \textbf{peer authentication} based on asymmetric
    challenge-response authentication(the challenge for the service is
    implicit, while for the client is explicit). Server authentication
    is alway compulsory, while client authentication is optional and
    requested by the server.
  \item \textbf{message confidentiality} base on symmetric encryption
  \item \textbf{message integrity} and authentication based on MAC
    computed on the trasmitted data
  \item \textbf{replay, filtering and reordering attack protection}
    using implicit record numbers( the correct order of transmission
    is provided by TCP, for this reason the number is implicit). This
    number is used also in the MAC computation.

\end{itemize}

You can see the TLS packet structure in figure
\ref{fig:tls-packet-structure}.
The TLS handshake protocol is used to establish a new session or 
reestablish an existing session. The TLS change cipher spec protocol 
is used to trigger the change of the algorithms to be used for message 
protection, or most notably to pass from the previous unprotected 
session to a protected one. The TLS alert protocol is used to signal
errors or signal the end of the connection. 
The TLS record protocol contains the generic protocols informations
and its content depend of the state of the connection and the protocol
it is tunneling.

\section{TLS session and connection}
It is important to make a clear distinction between TLS session and
connections.\\
\textbf{TLS sessions} a \textbf{logical association} between client and server, created
via an handshake protocol and its shared between different TLS
connections(1:N).\\
\textbf{TLS connections} are a \textbf{transient TLS channel} between client and server,
which means that each connection is associated with only one specific
TLS session(1:1).

\begin{figure}[H]
  \centering
  \includegraphics[width=.7\textwidth]{img/TLS session connection.png}
  \caption{TLS session and connection.}
  \label{fig:tls-session-and-connection}
\end{figure}
\section{TLS handshake protocol}
The TLS handshake protocol is used to establish a new session or
reestablish an existing session. It's a critical part of the TLS
protocol, because the channel pass from an unprotected state to a
protected one. During this phase the two parts agree
agree on a set of algorithms for confidentiality and integrity,
exchange random numbers between the client and the server to be used
for the subsequent generation of the keys, establish a symmetric key
by means of public key operations (originally RSA and DHKE, but
nowadays the elliptic curve versions of algorithms are used) and negotiate the
session-id and exchange the necessary public keys certificates for the
asymmetric challenge-response authentication.

\section{Achieving Data protection}
Data protection is achieved by using symmetric encryption algorithms
to encrypt the data and Message Authentication Codes(MAC) to ensure
the integrity of the data and the authentication of the sender.\\
Figure \ref{fig:tls-data-protection} shows how the data protection is 
achived in TLS using authenticate-then-encrypt approachm, but also
encrypt-then-authenticate is possible.\\
The MAC is computed over the data(compressed or not), the TLS sequence 
number and the key used for the MAC computation. The padding is also
part of the MAC computation to avoid those attacks that change the
padding.\\
The MAC is then encrypted with the dedicated symmetric key and a
suitable initialization vector(IV) 

\begin{figure}[H]
  \centering
  \includegraphics[width=.5\textwidth]{img/TLS data protection.png}
  \caption{TLS data protection.}
  \label{fig:tls-data-protection}
\end{figure}

The keys are \textbf{directional}, so there are two keys( one for
client to server and one for server to client) to protect against
reuse of the sequence number in the opposite direction.

\section{Perfect Forward Secrecy}
Since the keys are generated from asymmetric crypto, if the private
key is compromised, all the previous communication can be decrypted.
In this context, perfect forward secracy is desirable.
\begin{boxH}
  \textbf{Perfect Forward Secrecy} is a property of key-agreement
  protocols ensuring that the compromise of the secret key used for 
  will compromise only current (and eventually future) traffic but not
  the past one
\end{boxH}
The most common way to achieve this is to use ephiemeral keys, which
are one-time asymmetric keys( used for key exchange) 

\section{The protocol}
The TLS handshake is always initiated by the client. 

\subsection{Client Hello and Server Hello}
In version 1.2 the client sends a Client Hello, which contains:
\begin{itemize}
  \item the SSL version preferred by the client, and the highest
    supported(2=SSL-2, 3.0=SSL-3, 3.1=TLS-1.0, \dots)
  \item a 28 bytes pseudo-random number, which is the client random
  \item a session-id, which is empty if the client is starting a new
    session, and not empty if the client is trying to resume a 
    previous session
  \item a list of cipher suites supported by the client, in order to 
    let the server choose the most secure one.
  \item a list of compression methods supported by the client
\end{itemize}

And then a server hello is sent back, which contains:
\begin{itemize}
  \item the SSL version chosen by the server
  \item a 28 bytes pseudo-random number, which is the server random
  \item a session identifier(session-id), which is a new one if the
    server is starting a new session, and the same as the client's if
    the server is resuming a previous session
  \item the cipher suite chosen by the server, the strongest one
    common between the client and the server
  \item the compression method chosen by the server
\end{itemize}

  \end{subfigure}
\end{figure}

\subsection{Cipher suite}
A cipher suite is a set of cryptographic algorithms used in the TLS
protocol. A typical cipher suite consists of a key exchange algorithm,
the symmetric encryption algorithm, and the hash function used for 
generating MACs.
Some example of those are:
\begin{itemize}
  \item SSL\_NULL\_WITH\_NULL\_NULL
  \item SSL\_RSA\_WITH\_NULL\_SHA
  \item SSL\_RSA\_EXPORT\_WITH\_RC2\_CBC\_40\_MD5
  \item SSL\_RSA\_WITH\_3DES\_EDE\_CBC\_SHA
\end{itemize}


\subsection{Certificates}
The server sends its certificate to the client for server
authentication.
% there should lie the server authentication even if ephimeral keys
% are not used

Optionally, the server can request a certificate from the client for
client authentication. In this case the server specifies the list of
trusted CA's, and the client sends its certificate chain. The browsers
show to the users (for a connection) only the certificates issued by
trusted CAs.
If client certificate verification is required, an explicit request to
send the hash computed over all the handshake messages before this 
one and encrypted with the client private key is sent to the client.

\subsection{Key exchange}
The key exchange is the most important part of the handshake protocol.
The server key exchange message is sent only if the

\subsection{Change cipher spec}
The change cipher spec message used to trigger the change of the
algorithms to be used for message protection. It allows to pass from
the previous unprotected messages to the protection of the next
messages with algorithms and keys just negotiated, thus is technically
a protocol on its own and not part of the handshake. Some analysis
even say that it could be removed from it.


\subsection{Finished message}
The finished message is the last message of the handshake protocol,
and the first message protected by the negotiated keys and algorithms.
It is necessary to ensure that the handshake has not been tampered
with, and it contains contains a MAC computed over all the previous
handshake messages (but change cipher spec) using as a key the master
secret. Notice that the finished message is different for the client 
and the server, because the MAC is computed over different messages.

This allows to prevent rollback man-in-the-middle attacks (version
downgrade or ciphersuite downgrade)

\section{Setup Time}
The setup time is the time required to establish a secure connection 
between the client and the server. TLS depends on TCP, so the TCP
handshake must be taken into account. Then the TLS handshake is
performed, meaning that typically 3 RTTs (1 for TCP and 2 for TLS) are
required to establish a secure connection. Usually after 180ms the two
parties are ready to send protected data( assuming 30ms delay
one-way).

\section{TLS versions}
\subsection{TLS 1.0}
TLS 1.0, or SSL 3.1, was released in 1999. It is the first version of
the protocol, and it is based on SSL 3.0. Previous version were using
proprietary solutions, so the adoption of open standards was strongly
encouraged.

\subsection{TLS 1.1}
TLS 1.1 was released in 2006, and it introduced some security fixes
especially to protect against CBC attacks. In fact, the implicit
IV is replaced with an explicit IV to protect against CBC attacks.
Also protection against padding oracle attacks were instroduces to
reduce the information leaks. For this reason Passing errors now use
the bad\_record\_mac alert message (rather than the decryption\_failed
one). Furthermore, premature closes no longer cause a session to be non-
resumable.

\subsection{TLS 1.2}
TLS 1.2 was released in 2008, and it introduced some new features and 
improvements. The chipersuite also specifies the pseudo random
function instead of leaving the choice to the implementation. The
sha-1 algorithm was replaced with SHA-256, and its also added support
for authenticated encryption, such as AES in GCN or CCM mode.

All the chipersuites tat use IDEA and DES are deprecated.

\section{TLS attacks}
\subsection{Heartbleed}
Heartbleed is a security bug in the OpenSSL cryptography library,
which is a widely used implementation of the TLS protocol. It was able
to exploit the fact that the heartbeat extension keeps the connection
alive without the need to negituate the SSL session again. The
attacker could send a heartbeat request, but the length of the 
response is much longer( up to 64KB) than the actual data sent by the
client. This attack could then allow to leak memory contents.
